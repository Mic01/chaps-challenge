	<h1>The Aim Of The Game</h1>
	<p>
		The aim of the game is to get from the starting position to the end of each level. This is done by collecting keys and other
		resources that can be used to move around the map.

		Each level has a timer. You must complete the level before the timer runs out, or you will lose.
	</p>
